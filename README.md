# dotfiles
These are my initialization files for some programs and terminals

## Contents

### bash

Contains a handful of aliases for the Bash shell.

### emacs

If you know what `init.el` is there's probably nothing useful for you here, maybe check out [@M42's .emacs.d](https://github.com/M42/.emacs.d) instead.

### fish

If you use the Fish shell and you want to configure Renv for your R development, you've come to the right place. Otherwise nothing to see here.
